                Advances in machine learning have led to Large Language Models (LLMs) and other forms of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can interpret and generate information at a level comparable to expert humans. Such models have tremendous value for research in the behavioral sciences; however, research is only beginning to exploit their potential. 

Our EADM Summer School will expose you to the potential of generative AI focusing on LLMs, equip you with the tools to leverage LLMs for research openly and responsibly, and showcase how behavioral scientists can help study and address the ethical, cultural, and societal challenges arising from the mass adoption of generative AI.
